## GeoAwesomeness

This repo is a Proof of Concept for a **group** tracking service in near-real time. The goal is to display the map
around a pre-defined location and update the position of all the members of the group periodically.

 It has two components:
 * Client: An HTML page that leverages the Google Maps API to display the current positions of the group.
 * Server: Nodejs application that provides an API to store and retrieve the group's locations.

## Client

TBD

## Server
